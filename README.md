" Forecasting Application for Inventory Management " 

In this particular project, a profile of company that has four different suppliers is being studied. Product level analysis is done with respect to attributes like, number of days required to deliver particular product, cost of the total shipment as well as demand of the product. The main aim of this project is to study historical data available, observe patterns and then predict what the company should expect for their next shipment. It focuses on time series forecasting , which is achieved by implementing various different algorithms available at hand. An effort is made to provide accurate predictions for the company, based on which they can make informed decisions. This is a part of my Master thesis project.
